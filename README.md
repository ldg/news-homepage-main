## Overview

### The challenge

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Toggle the mobile menu (requires some JavaScript)

## My process

My approach to this project was to first consider the markup I'd need to build out the website as outlined in design specifications. I knew I wanted to build it mobile-first, I chose to limit the breakpoints to generic sizes rather than try to support too many devices. In the previous projects I'd tried supporting too many devices and I found it got too complex for me to manage effectively. So with this project I decided to simplify things, and be successful within that scope.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS

### What I learned

This project really helped me better understand the mobile-first work flow. In past projects I more naturally built from the desktop first and used media queries on smaller screens. Working through this project I could see the benifits of working mobile first. It's much more efficient, I fould I spent less time struggling with getting layouts to work on different screen sizes because each layout builds upon the previous screensize's layout.

I used SASS on this project, I found I needed to limit my use of partials rather than create a very structured series of nested .scss files. While I can see the benefit of nesting everything on larger website, I think for this project it was easier for me to keep track of styles with minimal partials


### Continued development

In the short term I want to improve my understanding of vanilla Javascript, because I'd really like to explore React, and learn to work with static site generators. My primary experience is working with Wordpress, so I'd love to be able to move into using something like Gatsby with headless Wordpress.
